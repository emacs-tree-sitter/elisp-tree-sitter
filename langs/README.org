This is a convenient bundle of language grammars and queries for ~tree-sitter~. It serves as an interim distribution mechanism, until ~tree-sitter~ is widespread enough for language major modes to include these definitions on their own.

Basically it's a multi-phase adoption process:

1. ~tree-sitter-langs~ populates global registries of grammars and queries. These global registries are defined by ~tree-sitter-mode~ and other ~tree-sitter~-based language-agnostic minor modes, to extend existing major modes.

2. New ~tree-sitter~-based language-specific minor modes use these global registries to extend existing major modes.

3. Major modes adopt new ~tree-sitter~-based features, and distribute the grammars and queries on their own. They can either put these definitions in the global registries, or keep using them only internally.
